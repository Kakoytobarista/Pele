System check identified some issues:

WARNINGS:
?: (rest_framework.W001) You have specified a default PAGE_SIZE pagination rest_framework setting, without specifying also a DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS.
	HINT: The default for DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS is None. In previous versions this was PageNumberPagination. If you wish to define PAGE_SIZE globally whilst defining pagination_class on a per-view basis you may silence this check.
